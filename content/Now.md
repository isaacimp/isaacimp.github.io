I am in Singapore. I love this city and how it got to be the thriving and wealthy place that it is today. It's my first time here but I have no doubts that I will come back. Walking the streets alone is an inspiration let alone visiting the architectural marvels or the bustling CBD or bookshops or startup hubs. It's very cool. Although, talking to people here does make me appreciate my home city of Melbourne more as many Singaporeans seem to love Melbourne and many would love to live there. I guess that's the classic story of not appreciating what you've got but I do wish Melbourne had more of the 'progress good' energy. Besides that Melbourne really isn't a bad place and I'm sure I can find that energy somewhere.

We are only here for a few more days until moving on again to our next stop but we have been so busy here that it feels like the city is ours already. I hope that I can create things with the quality and speed that you find commonplace here and I am inspired to do so when I return home.

*Health*
I'm not doing so good health-wise as I've had to resort to eating chips here when I can't find safe gluten free food. I really need to just accept that maybe i'll have to be OK with lots of liquids while travelling because the chips really make me flare up. 

*Interesting purchase*
I bought a [Garmin Venu 4 - 45mm](https://www.garmin.com.sg/products/wearables/venu-4-45-black/) here in Singapore yesterday. So far it's been great. The main reason I went with Garmin was due to the lack of subscription model for using the device and the fact that the data is accessible to the public so I can use my data from the watch for my own personal databases and uses. This along with the sensors and features made it seem worthwhile. The venu 3 looks pretty good too as well as some other Garmin watches but this was the top of the line so I just got it so I wouldn't feel the need to upgrade any time soon.
