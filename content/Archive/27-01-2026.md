[[Now]] [[Archive]]
We are in Vietnam for the second time now. This time we are taking it slower and enjoying each place more and relaxing more then last time when we were younger and thought we had to do everything all at once. We are here for a few more days and then are flying to Singapore for a few days and then finally to Bali on the way back home to Melbourne.

I am typing this now in a hotel room in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with my steam deck which is setup on a phone stand and i'm using a [fold out keyboard](https://www.protoarc.com/en-gb/products/xk01-tri-fold-bluetooth-keyboard-uk-layout?variant=40593446338649) that I bought for this trip.

Right now the main thing that I am working on is this very site. I recently came across [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is the software that I am using to create this site and right away I loved how it looked and since I use obsidian quite regularly, it seemed like a great fit.

I also just watched a video by [Sylvan Franklin](https://www.youtube.com/@sylvanfranklin) which was basically a casual interview/ showing of someones obsidian vault (this is also where I learned of Quartz) and the video really showed me how much further I could go with obsidian. I definitely prefer to keep things more simple then the guy in the video because I don't really like the whole second brain idea, that's not what I use obsidian for and neither is for memory keeping so I wont go as far as him but I can definitely make it better and faster for me to work with. That video is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTT2iBSwZs)
