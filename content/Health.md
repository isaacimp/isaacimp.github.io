# SIBO annihilation plan

## SIBO
- Common among celiac patients and also can interfere with celiac recovery due to malabsorption issues and food still not agreeing + less healing of the gut due to heavy bacterial load. 
### Plan

#### Phase 1: The Elemental diet:
The aim of this mix is to yield 2500kcal a day - while getting all of the most important vitamins and minerals and not getting all off the junk and bacteria feeding foods. Mix with water (amount for desired thickness); blend and sip slowly. 
Desired vitamins, minerals, electrolytes should be purchased in bulk and according to needs. Pure sugar or honey should be used as the carb source for quick absorption. Coconut oil or in the case of fat malabsorption — mct oil should be used as a source of fat as well as nutrients.

•  Amino acids: 2 Tbsp (≈24 g protein; 72 g/day total). Use a pure blend like Jo Mar Labs Black Label Pure Form 21 Blend.

•  Carbs: Choose one:
	honey (clear for better absorption) amount as required.
	AND OR glucose powder;	
•  Fats: 3–3.5 Tbsp oil (≈42–49 g fat/meal; 126–147 g/day). Use MCT, coconut, olive, or mix. Higher carb = lower oil; start low if fat malabsorption.

•  Multivitamin: 2 capsules (e.g., Pure Encapsulations Nutrient 950; open into drink if needed).
•  Salt: ¼–½ tsp (unrefined like Celtic or Real Salt for electrolytes).

#### Phase 2: Reintroduction
During this phase, the formula should be used on a decreasing schedule each day taking less and less as the diet slowly accounts for more of the required caloric and nutrient needs.
The diet should be one of slow addition where foods that are the safest and most well tolerated are introduced with care and logged/ reversed in the case of a negative reaction. Foods will be added one food per day or two to allow for more accurate symptom tracking.

This phase will also be accompanied by a mixture of bacteria suppressing mixtures to avoid regrowth as foods are added back into the diet. These will also be added slowly and taken as teas when possible.

#### Phase 3: New norm
By this time (after SIBO protocol + healing during reintroduction) my gut should have largely healed and be ready for more normal diet as was started in the reintroduction period. Foods that cause any reaction should still be avoided but here are some foods that I really enjoy and hope to include:
- Pho (beef, meats, gelatines, veggies etc)
- Butter chicken curry made with the proper spices
- Milk, OJ, cheese, cola and other basics
- Burgers, tacos, sandwich’
- Homemade gluten-free bread
