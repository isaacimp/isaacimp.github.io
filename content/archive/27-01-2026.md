I am typing this now in a hotel room in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with my steam deck which is setup on a phone stand and i'm using a [fold out keyboard](https://www.protoarc.com/en-gb/products/xk01-tri-fold-bluetooth-keyboard-uk-layout?variant=40593446338649) that I bought for this trip.

Right now the main thing that I am working on is this very site. I recently came across [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is the software that I am using to create this site and right away I loved how it looked and since I use obsidian quite regularly, it seemed like a great fit.

I also just watched a video by [Sylvan Franklin](https://www.youtube.com/@sylvanfranklin) which was basically a casual interview/ showing of someones obsidian vault (this is also where I learned of Quartz) and the video really showed me how much further I could go with obsidian. I definitely prefer to keep things more simple then the guy in the video because I don't really like the whole second brain idea, that's not what I use obsidian for and neither is for memory keeping so I wont go as far as him but I can definitely make it better and faster for me to work with. That video is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTT2iBSwZs)
