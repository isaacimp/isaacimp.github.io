Due to the large influx of 'influencers' and health gurus, the work of Raymond Peat is often missinterpreted as people are viewing it under the lens of a person 
tring to makea  name for themselves or sell a product. Ray never tried to 'sell' his ideas. He had an incredible and complete understanding of biology
and with the understanding he developed very solid and well formed explainations and theories as to how we can best operate and navigate the health landscape 
that we find ourselves in.
